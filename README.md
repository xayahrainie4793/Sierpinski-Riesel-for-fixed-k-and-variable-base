These are the status for all Sierpinski/Riesel bases 2<=b<=1024 for fixed k<=12.

Search limit: 6000 for all (k,b) combo.

Files read as:

* "k,n": the smallest value n such that (k\*b^n+-1)/gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) is (probable) prime.
* "k,NA": (k\*b^n+-1)/gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) possibly has prime, but no (probable) primes of this form are known.
* "k,covering set": (k\*b^n+-1)/gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) proven to be composite for all n, by covering set.
* "k, full algebra factors": (k\*b^n+-1)/gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) proven to be composite for all n (or only be prime for very small n), by all algebraic factors.
* "k, partial algebra factors: (k\*b^n+-1)/gcd(k+-1,b-1) (+ for Sierpinski, - for Riesel) proven to be composite for all n, by partial algebraic factors.
